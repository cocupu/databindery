== CoCuPu

== Trying it out
The default server (webbrick) performs poorly.  Instead run:
<pre>
$ unicorn_rails
</pre>

== Deploying
Need to run this after deploying to a new MongoDB:
<pre>
script/rails runner 'Delayed::Backend::Mongoid::Job.create_indexes'
</pre>

== Workers
In development:
<pre>
$ rake jobs:work
</pre>

In production:
<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job stop

# Runs two workers in separate processes.
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job -n 2 start
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job stop
</pre>
